 # Walmart Sales Analysis Using Python and SQL

 ## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. I used Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions.

# Business Problems

## 1. Analyze Payment Methods and Sales
  * Question: What are the different payment methods, and how many transactions and
items were sold with each method?
  * Objective: To understand customer preferences for payment methods, which aids us in developing 
payment optimization strategies.
## 2. Identify the Highest-Rated Category in Each Branch
  * Question: Which category received the highest average rating in each branch?
  * Objective: To allow Walmart to recognize and promote popular categories in specific
branches, enhancing customer satisfaction and branch-specific marketing.
## 3. Determine the Busiest Day for Each Branch
  * Question: What is the busiest day of the week for each branch based on transaction
volume?
  * Objective: This insight helps in optimizing staffing and inventory management to
accommodate peak days.
## 4. Calculate Total Quantity Sold by Payment Method
  * Question: How many items were sold through each payment method?
  * Objective: To help Walmart track sales volume by payment type and to provide insights
into customer purchasing habits.
## 5. Analyze Category Ratings by City
  * Question: What are the average, minimum, and maximum ratings for each category in
each city?
  * Objective: This data can guide city-level promotions, allowing Walmart to address
regional preferences and improve customer experiences.
## 6. Calculate Total Profit by Category
  * Question: What is the total profit for each category, ranked from highest to lowest?
  * Objective: Identifying high-profit categories helps focus efforts on expanding these
products or managing pricing strategies effectively.
## 7. Determine the Most Common Payment Method per Branch
  * Question: What is the most frequently used payment method in each branch?
  * Objective: This information aids in understanding branch-specific payment preferences,
potentially allowing branches to streamline their payment processing systems.
## 8. Analyze Sales Shifts Throughout the Day
  * Question: How many transactions occur in each shift (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
across branches?
  * Objective: This insight helps in managing staff shifts and stock replenishment schedules,
especially during high-sales periods.
## 9. Identify Branches with the Highest Revenue Decline Year-Over-Year
  * Question: Which branches experienced the largest decrease in revenue compared to
the previous year?
  * Objective: To detect branches with declining revenue and to understand
possible local issues and thereby create strategies to boost sales or mitigate losses.
